# javscript-game
A basic decision-based game built with JavaScript that runs in the terminal using Node.js is a text-driven interactive program where the player progresses through a story or scenario by making choices. The game runs entirely in the command line.

# Overview
This is a basic decision based game written in JavaScript that runs in the terminal using Node.js. The game is text driven and progresses through a small story where the player makes choices by typing input into the command line. Each choice leads to a different outcome or scene.

The project is intentionally simple. It does not use a graphical interface, external libraries, or frameworks. All interaction happens through standard input and output in the terminal. The goal of the project is to practice program flow, conditional logic, and handling user input in Node.js.

The game starts by displaying a short introduction. At certain points, the player is asked to choose between multiple options. Based on the input, the program follows a specific branch of logic and continues the story until an ending is reached. The game can be restarted without restarting the program.

To run the game, Node.js must be installed on the system. After cloning the repository and navigating into the project directory, the game can be started by running node game.js in the terminal.

This project is meant for learning and experimentation. It can be extended by adding more scenes, more choices, player state, or better input validation. The focus is not complexity, but clarity.
